					<p>This website is all about the diffrent categories of sports.
					Here is some basic intro what sport is.</p>
					<p>The word “sports” comes from the ancient French: "se desporter" or "se déporter" and became "to deport" in English. It meant "amuse". Sometimes violent, with natural and brutal movements at the beginning, English people enjoyed themselves playing traditional sports. Sport was only fun. Then it opted for competition. After the English industrial revolution English people codified the rules of sport and gradually organized it around clubs. Sport really developed in the middle of the XIXth century. </p>
