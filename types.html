								<h3>Cricket</h3>

							</div>
							<p>Cricket is a very popular modern sport. However, its history takes us back to the Middle Ages.</p>
                            <p>
                            Cricket was never appreciated out of Great Britain, perhaps because of its slowness and the difficulties of its rules, contrary to the other sports. It was despised by the upper-class before the XVIIth century. The nobility started to play cricket in the middle of the XVIIth century. In 1820, there were two crickets: 

                           - One for the gentry  
                           - One for the lower and middle-classes
                           </p>

								<h3>Golf</h3>

							<p>Another popular and expensive game, because the land it demands, is golf, which is a Scottish game.</p>
							<p>
							Golf was born in China, in the Xth century, and was named "chiuwan". The players knocked a ball in holes, with a cane. In the Middle-ages it was introduced in Europe. Then, in the XIVth century, a similar game appeared, with different names "kolf" or "cambuc" in England, "hurley" in Ireland, "shinty" in Scotland, "chole" in France, and "pall mall" in Italy. The players played it in the country, with a ball and a curved staff. They didn't put the ball in holes, but projected it on targets, generally doors. Because his archers played instead of working golf was forbidden in 1457 by James 1st, king of Scotland. In 1608, James 1st allowed golf again and founded in Blackheath a course with 7 holes. In 1744, the Company of Gentlemen Golfers, now the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, was created. Deciding in 1858 that golf would be played with 18 holes, The Society of Saint Andrews, now the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of Saint Andrews, was founded in 1754 in Scotland.</p>

							<p>Basketball is a limited-contact sport played on a rectangular court. While most often played as a team sport with five players on each side, three-on-three, two-on-two, and one-on-one competitions are also common. The objective is to shoot a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through a hoop 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter and 10 feet (3.048 m) high that is mounted to a backboard at each end of the court. The game was invented in 1891 by Dr. James Naismith.
